## Code of Conduct

We have no issues with joking around or being a little silly at times, in fact   
we even encourage you to keep conversations light and interesting.

Working with us should be fun, and our maintainers and core team   
members are generally very open-minded and can take a joke.

However, there are still a few things to keep in mind in order   
to ensure a pleasant working environment for everybody.

Always respect others and their opinions, keep an open mind,   
and don't judge people based on their lifestyle or appearance.

## Git Commit Message Style

- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Use the present tense ("Add foo" not "Added foo")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move quix to..." not "Moves quix to...")
